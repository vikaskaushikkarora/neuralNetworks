# Neural Networks

This repository contains the application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have made two simple neural networks here :

### 1) One which tells if the given number is positive or negative

### 2) And another which can tell which digit (0-9) is there in a given image (just like human beings)

No extensive libraries of python for Machine Learning (e.g. Keras, ScikitLearn, Theano and Tensorflow) are used. Only Numpy and Matplotlib are used because the main aim was to build the Neural Network from scratch and understand the basic and fundamental concepts of Neural Networking.

## How and why did I learn about Neural Networks ?

The idea that machines can do stuff without exiplicitly programmed to do so is amazing, because it involves the learning itself for the machine. Also the stucture of neurons in our brains is kind of similar to the neural networks. So I was inspired by this idea that I can make artificial brain of my own using my smartphone!

I watched [3Blue-1Brown's playlist on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) about Neural Networks and I was hugely inspired to make a Neural Network of my own. I also watched [Welch Labs' videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiaHhY2iBX9hdHaRr6b7XevZtgZRa1PoU) on the same topic. From there I came to know about an amazing book on [Neural Networks by Michael Neilson](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). I read the book and learnt some other technical aspects of Neural Networks.
