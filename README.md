# Neural Networks

This repository contains the application of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I have made two simple neural networks here :

### 1) One which tells if the given number is positive or negative

### 2) And another which can tell which digit (0-9) is there in a given image (just like human beings)

No extensive libraries of python for Machine Learning (e.g. Keras, ScikitLearn, Theano and Tensorflow) are used. Only Numpy and Matplotlib are used because the main aim was to build the Neural Network from scratch and understand the basic and fundamental concepts of Neural Networking.
